# How to visualize curved geometry
Bridging from flat space (or Euclidean space) to curved space is a big step. To build a platform to visualize curved geometry, one has to start from curved line. The main goal of foundation building is to construct a space geometry that can draw any sub-geometry on that. Focusing on maximum 2-dimensional curved surface study, 3-dimensional Euclidean space is enough. Therefore, I build a 3-dimensional points cloud with arbitrary points on each sides.
